# Firebase Authentication Setup Guide

## ðŸ”¥ What I've Built For You

I've implemented a complete Firebase Authentication system with:
- âœ… Email/Password Sign Up
- âœ… Email/Password Sign In
- âœ… Google Sign In
- âœ… Password Reset
- âœ… Turkish language error messages
- âœ… Proper form validation
- âœ… Automatic redirects after successful auth

## ðŸš€ What You Need To Do

### Step 1: Create a Firebase Project

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Click "Create a project" or "Add project"
3. Enter your project name (e.g., "tera-map")
4. Choose whether to enable Google Analytics (optional)
5. Click "Create project"

### Step 2: Enable Authentication

1. In your Firebase project, click "Authentication" in the left sidebar
2. Click "Get started"
3. Go to the "Sign-in method" tab
4. Enable the following providers:
   - **Email/Password**: Click "Enable" toggle
   - **Google**: Click "Enable" toggle, add your support email

### Step 3: Add Your Website to Firebase

1. In the Firebase project overview, click the web icon `</>`
2. Enter your app nickname (e.g., "tera-map-web")
3. Check "Also set up Firebase Hosting" if you want (optional)
4. Click "Register app"
5. **IMPORTANT**: Copy the `firebaseConfig` object - you'll need this!

### Step 4: Update Your Code

Replace the placeholder Firebase configuration in **BOTH** files:

#### In `kaydol.html` (around line 8):
```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID", 
  storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
};
```

#### In `signin.html` (around line 8):
```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com", 
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
};
```

**Replace the placeholder values with your actual Firebase config values!**

### Step 5: Configure Authorized Domains (Important!)

1. In Firebase Console, go to Authentication > Settings
2. In the "Authorized domains" section, add your domain:
   - For local development: `localhost`
   - For production: your actual domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`)

### Step 6: Test Your Authentication

1. Open your website
2. Try signing up with a new email
3. Check your Firebase Console > Authentication > Users to see if the user was created
4. Try signing in with the created account
5. Test Google sign-in
6. Test password reset

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Firebase is not defined" error**
   - Make sure you replaced the Firebase config with your actual values
   - Check browser console for specific errors

2. **Google Sign-in not working**
   - Make sure you enabled Google authentication in Firebase Console
   - Check if your domain is added to authorized domains

3. **"auth/unauthorized-domain" error**
   - Add your domain to authorized domains in Firebase Console

4. **Users not appearing in Firebase Console**
   - Double-check your Firebase config values
   - Make sure you're looking at the correct project

### Testing Locally:

If testing on localhost, make sure to:
1. Add `localhost` to authorized domains in Firebase
2. Use `http://localhost:YOUR_PORT` or `http://127.0.0.1:YOUR_PORT`
